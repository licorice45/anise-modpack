![Anise Modpack](./anise_logo.png)
# Description
Anise is a simple modpack with 3 main goals:
- Make player feel more like a glass cannon
- Add more steps to progression
- And of course, some new content sprinkled in ;)
# Progression changes
All tools besides wood tier require smithing table and a common upgrade template (made from pebbles and canvas/leather). Stone tools are replaced with copper tools and gold is now on par with iron. Crystals need polishing before usage with either sand paper or grindstone.
